## viNLaP

Welcome to viNLaP: Visualizing Natural Language Processing on polarized data sources!

This project was conceived due to the need of visualize polarized data easily and effectively. The first version of vinLAp aims to show an overview of the MAGA corpus, crawled in GSoC 2018 by Maja Goudoz- For doing so, it focuses on three aspects, each one modeled with a specific type of visualization. These aspects are: variability of the vocabulary by each side using Scattertexts, speech changes between geographic regions using GeoSpeech and, speech generation from a specific word using Speech Igniters.

Even though our case of study is MAGA corpus, viNLap has been designed and developed to be versatile enoguh for any dataset that contains geolocated documents. There is a whole bunch of things to keep working on to improve the analysis, but we are sure is the first step to put NLP closer to end users.

It was developed by 2019 GSoC student, Fabricio Layedra; under the supervision of Guy De Pauw.
